This is a replica of a JSM tutorial titled Sushiman. Personal goals for following the tutorial:

1. Strengthen my understanding of HTML organization and common practices.
   i.e. Block element encapsulation using HTML5's header, section, and footer elements.
2. Learn BEM model to better organize CSS elements.
3. Strengthen understanding of responsive design through the use of flex.
4. Use AOS API to create seamless transitions on scroll.
